      # Help/Feedback

      See [Help - User manual](https://onecommander.com/help)

      This program doesn't attempt to be just a better-looking Windows File
      Explorer with tabs or a MacOS Finder for Windows with columns, but to
      challenge the existing workflows that remained unchanged since the '90s.
      That is where your feedback comes in, and with it, the program is
      constantly evolving.

      If you are a designer, you can even improve the look by editing theme xaml
      files or creating your own file or folder icons.
