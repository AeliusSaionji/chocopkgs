mpv is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer. It shares some features with the former projects while introducing many more.

##Streamlined CLI options##
MPlayer's options parser was improved to behave more like other CLI programs, and many option names and semantics were reworked to make them more intuitive and memorable.

##On Screen Controller##
While mpv has no official GUI, it has a small controller that is triggered by mouse movement.

##High quality video output##
mpv has a OpenGL based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, and more.

##GPU video decoding##
mpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support VDPAU, VAAPI, DXVA2, VDA and VideoToolbox video decode acceleration.

##Embeddable##
A straightforward C API was designed from the ground up to make mpv usable as a library and facilitate easy integration into other applications.

##Active development##
mpv is under active development, focusing on code refactoring and cleanups as well as adding features. Want a feature? Post a patch or request it!
