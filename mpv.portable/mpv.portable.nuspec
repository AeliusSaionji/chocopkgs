Deprecated in favor of the package named mpvio.  

What's the difference between this package and `mpvio`? None, but this package is stuck following a now defunct version scheme of mpv.   
Why does the `mpv` package use a different version than the official project? Long ago, the Windows builds of mpv were provided by a contributor who made Windows specific changes to mpv. Since the chocolatey package was following that specific build, it made sense (at the time) to mirror that build's version scheme.  
Unfortunately, the chocolatey community repo maintains a philosophical stance that prevents this package ID from ever being recovered. Sorry.
