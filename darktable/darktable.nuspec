# by photographers

darktable is created for photographers, by photographers.

Having developers that are also avid photographers as part of the target audience is good for understanding the real world problems, challenges, and workflows.


# powerful

darktable edits your images non-destructively all the way through its pipeline. Your original image is never modified! Professional color management features ensure fidelity all the way to print and GPU accelerated processing means you can speed up your workflow using your video card.
